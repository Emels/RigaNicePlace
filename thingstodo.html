 <h2 class="foodheading"> Fantastic things to do in Riga </h2>
</div>
  <div>
    <p>If you go to Riga, here’s what you cannot miss!</p>
  </div>
<div>
 <h3>1. THE OLD TOWN </h3>
</div>
<div>
   <p>The Old Town is the oldest section of Riga as well as the center of the city. It is the city’s most popular area with tourists. In 1997, Riga's historic center was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The Old Town's streets and squares have numerous restaurants and cafes for all tastes.</p>

<div>
  <h3>2. THE ART NOUVEAU ARCHITECTURE </h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Riga experienced its golden age in the early 20th century just as Art Nouveau architecture was coming into fashion, and so the city has one of the world’s richest collections of this exuberant style.
    There are over 800 amazing Art Nouveau structures throughout the city, but the greatest concentration is on Alberta iela, a street largely built in a flurry of creativity by a single architect, Mikhail Eisenstein.</p>

  <h3> 3. LIVE LIKE A LATVIAN </h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>You don’t have to travel far in Riga to escape the urban bustle. Located right on the city’s doorstep, the Open Air Ethnographic Museum is a luscious lakeside park where fine examples of vernacular architecture from all over Latvia have been lovingly preserved. Step back in time by visiting peasant homes, workshops, windmills and priceless treasures like the richly ornamented Usma Church. The museum displays 118 historic buildings from all Latvian regions - Kurzeme, Vidzeme, Zemgale and Latgale dating from the 17th century to the beginning of 1930s.</p>

  <h3> 4. SHOP LIKE A LATVIAN </h3>
</div>
<div>
 <p>Riga Central Market (Latvian: Rīgas Centrāltirgus) is Europe's largest market and bazaar in Riga, Latvia. It is one of the most notable structures from 20th century in Latvia. Taste-test a quick-pickled cucumber, buy vegetables straight from the farm or nursery, treat yourself to a freshly-smoked eel, or just embark on a walking tour of the one and only Riga Central Market. The Market has invariably remained in the very heart of Riga city, ensuring diverse shopping experience, a personal touch, lively conversation, tall tales and exuberant bargaining with the vendors.</p>

  </p>

<div>
  <h3> 5. THE CORNER HOUSE </h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Latvia’s turbulent and often tragic history during the 20th century is encapsulated in Riga’s KGB Headquarters, where many people were imprisoned during the Soviet occupation. In 1940-1941 and 1944-1990, chekists imprisoned, interrogated and, during the first year of occupation, also executed citizens, who were considered to be opponents to the occupation regime, inside the Corner House. A guided tour of the cells is a chilling experience you will remember for a long time.</p>
